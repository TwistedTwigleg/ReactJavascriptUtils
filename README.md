# Javascript Utils

A simple website with a set of Javascript powered utility functions that help with common functions without any ads or similar. Intended to help replace JSON lint and Base64 decode, which are great tools but I want to provide a solution without the ads since I often use both sites.

Uses [Mantine](https://ui.mantine.dev) components for the UI and Javascript code for everything else. Nothing is stored on Server and all is done in the client powered Javascript (at least for now). Also check out the package.json for other dependencies used.

*Note: This project sort of follows some React best practices but is mostly a learning project and a helper to make my life easier. As such, support, fixes, and code quality may vary. Thank you!*
